		"about": "This represents the number of months a mature tree needs to absorb a given quantity of CO2. While the amount of CO2 sequestered by a tree per unit of time depends on a number of factors, such as its species, size, or environment, it was estimated that a mature tree sequesters, on average, â‰ˆ11 kg of CO2 per year, giving the multiplier in tree-months a value close to 1 kg of CO2 per month (0.92 kg).
